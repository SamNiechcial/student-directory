student_count = 11
## first we print the list of students:
puts "The students of Villains Academy"
puts "-------------"
puts "Dr. Hannibal Lecter"
puts "Darth Vader"
puts "Nurse Ratched"
puts "Michael Corleone"
puts "Alex DeLarge"
puts "The Wicked Witch of the West"
puts "Terminator"
puts "Freddy Kruger"
puts "The Joker"
puts "Joffery Baratheon"
puts "Norman Bates"
# finally, we print the total number of students
print "Overall, we have #{student_count} great students"
# it's important that print() doesn't add new line characters
# New lines can be added manually to print commands like so:
# print "line1\nline2\nline3"
# These \n escape characters need to be in double quotes!
